          <p>Using the web to tell stories has never been more exciting. Combining skills like filmmaking, journalism and web development can result in beautiful story experiences on the web. This is really exciting but in many ways still in its early stages of experimentation. Together with Gilles Pradeu, a filmmaker from France, I've started to think about how can we grow a community of web-native storytellers to encourage this multidisciplinary experimentation.</p>
          <p><a href="http://popathon.org">Popathon</a> is a series of events, bringing together visual storytellers, web developers and designers to collaborate on <a href="https://slid.es/phivk/born-on-the-web">web-native storytelling</a> projects. Key elements of the events are learning, making and sharing. The aim of these weekend-long hack jams is to experiment and create prototypes: projects that try out a focussed piece of functionality by using the capability of the web to create an interactive story experience. At the end of the weekend all prototypes are made available open-source.</p>
          <p>We're organising Popathon in cities like London, Lisbon, Paris and Barcelona and are building partnerships with people who are as passionate about this as we are to grow and sustain local communities.</p>
