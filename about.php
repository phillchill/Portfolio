        <p>Hi, my name is Philo. I live in London, where I graduated from the MSc Cognitive Computing at <a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Goldsmiths College</a>. I work at <a href="http://datashaka.com/" target="_blank">DataShaka</a> on a platform that helps to make more informed decisions based on unified data. I'm originally from Amsterdam, where I studied Artificial Intellingence and got into <a href="http://vimeo.com/phillchill" target="_blank">filmmaking</a>.</p> 

        <p>My background in AI and passion for filmmaking got me interested in the potential of the web for interactive storytelling. I believe we are currently lacking an interactive storytelling language that fits the nature of the web. I feel we need multidisciplinary experimentaiton to move this field forward and organise <a href="http://popathon.org/" target="_blank">a series of events</a> bringing together storytellers, web developers and designers to collaborate on web-native stories.</p>
          
        <p>I like to think about how technology can support learning and teaching and like to share my skills with people around me. I enjoy teaching others about programming in Python, interactive online video and web-native storytelling and have done so at places like <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/philo-van-kemenade/1234" target="_blank">General Assembly London</a>, <a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/">Goldsmiths College London</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/news/article/art20130711164644140" target="_blank">BBC Academy</a>.</p>

        <p>I co-founded <a href="http://tradeschool.coop/westminster/" target="_blank">Trade School Westminster</a> at the <a href="http://westminster.the-hub.net/" target="_blank">HUB Westminster</a> to let people exchange skills for barter items.</p>
        <p>I love cycling and walking on my hands.</p>
